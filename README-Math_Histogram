Package: Math_Histogram

These classes can be used to calculate histogram distributions
of data sets.

The Math_Histogram class computes histograms from unidimensional
data sets. These are also known as 2D historgrams, and can be
computed in the regular binned frequency or as cummulative frequency.

Similarly, the Math_Histogram3D and Math_Histogram4D classes compute
distributions from bi- and tri-dimensional data sets (respectively),
both in regular frequency and cummulative frequency modes.

This package requires the Math_Stats package, so if you do not have it
installed, you need to do:

	pear install Math_Stats

before you can start using Math_Histogram in your scripts.
